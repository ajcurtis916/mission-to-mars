# Mission to Mars Project Overview
## Web Scrape to Flask App

During the Mission to Mars project, we web scraped four different websites and obtained news headliners, informational data tables and pictures relating to Mars.</br>

Process: We utilized Splinter, BeautifulSoup and Chrome Driver Manager to link and parse our items from the websites, and used Python to create functions to display the items scraped to a local server utilizing a Flask App.  We then constructed and linked an html file, and formatted and cleaned the html code using Bootstrap to make our page appear more refined.  Each time the scrape button is pushed it will bring in the most recent elements from the pages we scraped.
