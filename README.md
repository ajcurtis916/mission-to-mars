# Mission to Mars Project Overview
## Web Scrape Mars Data to Flask App

During our Mission to Mars project, we web scraped four different websites (redplanetscience.com, spaceimages-mars.com, galaxyfacts-mars.com and marshemispheres.com), to obtain news headliners, informational data tables and pictures relating to Mars and it's hemispheres.</br>

Process: We utilized Splinter, BeautifulSoup and Chrome Driver Manager to link and parse our items from the websites, and used Python to create functions to display the items scraped to a local server utilizing a Flask App.  We then constructed and linked an html file, and formatted and cleaned the html code using Bootstrap to refine and stylize our page.  Each time the scrape button is clicked, it will bring in the most recent elements from the pages we scraped (i.e. the most recent Mars news headline from redplanetscience.com).

Flask Display as of March 13th, 2022:
